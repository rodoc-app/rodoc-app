# Files, Notes & Media

Each person can have an unlimited number of **files**, **media**, and **notes**. To organize files easily, every **person** has a separate virtual directory for each file type. When a file is already added to the database, it can be **shared** among other persons without making **duplicates**.

## Virtual Directories

Every virtual directory can be organized individually, just like in every file manager.

- **Renaming** a file or a directory. When renaming a file, it will be renamed for all persons, but the names of directories are not shared
- **Deleting** a file or a directory
- **Creating** a new directory
- **Adding** new files

Keep in mind that all the files need to be in a directory, thus there is always the **root** directory that cannot be deleted, but it can be renamed.

## Adding Files

We have three options for adding files:

1. Choosing a file that is **already in the database**
2. Making a **copy** of an already existing file from a computer
3. Creating a completely **new and empty file**

To keep the project internally consistent and clean, files are **permanently removed** upon saving the project if it happens that no **person** has access to them.
